# Infix to Postfix Converter

This project implements a simple Infix to Postfix Converter in C. It takes an infix expression (e.g., `A + B * C`) as input and converts it to its postfix equivalent (e.g., `A B C * +`) using a stack-based algorithm.


## Features

- Converts valid infix expressions to postfix notation.
- Handles operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parentheses `(`, `)`.
- Ensures operator precedence and associativity are maintained.
- Uses a stack to manage operators and parentheses during the conversion.


## Example Input/Output

### Input
```
Enter an infix expression: A + B * (C - D)
```

### Output
```
Postfix expression: A B C D - * +
```

---

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Basic understanding of infix and postfix expressions.

---

## Implementation Details

- The program uses a stack to store operators and parentheses.
- Operator precedence:
  - `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`.
- Associativity:
  - All operators are left-associative.
- Parentheses are used to explicitly define precedence.

---

## Limitations

- Assumes single-character operands (e.g., `A`, `B`).
- Does not evaluate the resulting postfix expression.
- Input must be syntactically valid.
