PII Data Detector

Overview

The PII Data Detector is a simple Python script designed to identify Personally Identifiable Information (PII) elements within a text file. PII elements include sensitive data such as email addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security Numbers (SSNs). This tool can be useful for data security, compliance checks, and data anonymization.

Purpose

The main purpose of this program is to help users easily scan through text files and identify any potential PII data. It can be particularly useful for:

Ensuring that documents do not contain sensitive information before sharing.

Auditing data files for compliance with data protection regulations 
Assisting in data anonymization processes.

Technologies Used

The program is written in Python and utilizes the following technologies:

Python Standard Library:

The script is built using Python's built-in libraries, primarily re for regular expressions, which allows pattern matching in text.

Regular Expressions (Regex): 

Regex patterns are used to identify PII elements such as emails, phone numbers, and SSNs in the text file.

Running the Script

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the pii_detector.py file is located.

Run the script by entering the following command:

python p2data.py
