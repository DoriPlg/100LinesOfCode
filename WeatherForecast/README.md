Key Features:

1.  Location Input: Users can input their location (city name or zip code) through the command line interface.
2.  Weather Retrieval: Utilize a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch current weather conditions and forecasts for the specified location.
3.  Display: Present the weather information in a clean and concise format, including details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
4.  Error Handling: Handle potential errors gracefully, such as invalid location input or network connectivity issues.
5.  Unit Conversion: Provide an option for users to choose between metric and imperial units for temperature and wind speed.
